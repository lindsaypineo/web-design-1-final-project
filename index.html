<h1>Hello and welcome to my about me!</h1> 
<h2>About me.</h2>

<div>
<p>My name is Lindsay Pineo and I am currently a student of graphic design at Algonquin college.</p>
 
<p>Through my studies I have developed a solid foundation in design principles and have gained experience with a variety of design tools, including Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), Figma and Sketch.</p>

<p> I am passionate about typography, layout design, and branding. I have also had the opportunity to experiment with other areas of design, such as motion graphics and web design. </p>
